        		<h2>Overview</h2>
				    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are using the news articles collected as part of the sentiment analysis employed by Alexandria covering stocks and
              adding additional factors to see how they affect the existing sentiment score. We are using social media impact in particular
              (Google Trends, Yahoo Finance et al) and analysing how the effect of the public’s reaction to the aforementioned articles had an
              impact (if any) on the pre-calculated sentiment and confidence value.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are pairing Google search history of each company over the time period surrounding articles for which we have sentiment
              scores.We will use a Google Trends API to capture this data for each company. Using the frequency of the company searches, we are defining a
              metric that captures the “traction” that an article has on the company’s stock. If a company receives positive or negative media attention and
              very few people are aware of the news, the impact of the news articles may be less significant.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We majorly used Google Trends to fetch the normalized interest a particular article generated over a certain period of time.
              By learning from this data, we train an algorithm with supervised learning, with the scores being the dependent variable,
              and the data gathered from Google trends the article being the independent variable.
