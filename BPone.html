            <h3>Vision:</h3>
				    <p>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are using the news articles collected as part of the sentiment analysis employed by
Alexandria covering stocks and adding additional factors to see how they affect the existing
score value. We will be using social media impact in particular (Google Trends, Yahoo Finance,
Twitter, Facebook et al) and analyse how the effect of the publicâ€™s reaction to the
aforementioned articles had an impact (if any) on the pre-calculated sentiment and confidence
Value. By learning from this data, we hope to train an algorithm with supervised learning, with
the scores being the dependent variable, and the appearance of words being the independent
variable.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By the end of our exploration, we hope to find an algorithm that can yield a score once given an
article covering a specific company. By analyzing this algorithm, we can also discover what kind
of words combination would be given a heavier weight leading to a higher score.
The ideal algorithm in mind right now is neural network, because the sheer number of
dimensions and the importance of understanding the interaction between different dimensions.</p>
<h3>Data:</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We have a Dataset from Professor Potter which has details about the scores assigned by
Alexandria and currently going through the relevant research papers associated with this. We
have to find a way to get the titles of the articles in order to scrape the social media/news
networks to find out more information about the aforementioned articles.</p>
<h3>Methodology:</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A large portion of the analysis will involve using our model to see how accurately the article
scores correlate with a favorable outcome for the company. One measure would be how the
stock price varies in relation to releases of articles about the company.
Visualization will also play an important role in how the data is analyzed by the user of our
data-driven software. If we make a web-app driven application, we can use D3 for the
visualization of the data. There are other options such as Tableau. The software we will use will
be chosen when we have a better idea of exactly what sort of visualizations we want in our
project.</p>
<h3>Next Steps:</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By the first TA checkin we plan to collect and clean the data. Additionally, we hope to have
preliminary visualization tools working that allow us to explore the data set. By exploring the
data set, we can begin planning/determining what type of neural network we will use for
calculating a news report score. Having spent some time with the data, we can discuss our
trajectory with TAs during the first checkin. By this point, we will also have a better idea how to
distribute tasks amongst the group members.
By the midterm report, we hope to have trained our neural network and have a preliminary
working model. If we do not succeed in developing a working model, we can re-evaluate if we
should pivot the project to another direction. If this is accomplished, we should be able to start
working on the data visualization tools and the analysis tools that allow the user to explore the
data set. Once again, the team can determine how to most efficiently divide the remaining tasks
to stay on schedule.</p>
