<h3>Updates on data source for traction score</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For the metric to determine traction we will use an optimized time period around the date
of the news article whose sentiment score we have. The time period will be determined after
further investigation. We will look at how much the Google search history for that company
varies around the date of the article compared to how frequently a company is searched on a
daily basis (found during a non overlapping time period in which the article was published). This
will provide a measure of how the article impacted the search history of the company. The basis
for defining the traction metric in this way is the assumption that news about a company will lead
to more searches for that company. If we receive article titles, we can also add a weighted
component of how frequently that article was searched to our overall measure of how frequently
the specific company was searched.</p>
<h3>Extrapolation of the Alexandria Research Methodology</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Alexandria research team measured the validity of the scores by categorizing the
stocks based on the average sentiment scores that the firm receives. It then tracked the returns
of different stock categories and was able to identify the sentiment score as a significant source
of alpha(outperformance).
Similar to the Alexandria methodology we can also analyze the validity of the “traction
score” which is a composite score that measures the impact of the media coverage on the
stocks. By breaking down stocks with similar average media sentiment scores based on the
level of impact that the media coverages have, we can identity if the “traction score” can be a
source of additional alpha.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Alexandria research team were careful to include the context of a sentence when
assigning it its sentiment score. They claim in their Daily Sentiment Study that this is one of the
factors that lead to a 90+% accuracy rate for all three classification types.
Also similar to how the Alexandria research team considered context when assigning
sentiment scores, we too may consider context when calculating an article's traction score.
When inspecting the time period around an article's publication date, we may also take into
account the number of similar articles, or articles about the same company or stock when
assigning the article's traction score (more similar articles means a particular article likely has a
lower effect on any changes to stock value, etc).</p>
