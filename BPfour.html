<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this final blogpost, we present the approaches that we have taken to
understand and enhance the Alexandria sentiment analysis as a source of alpha in
trading.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The methods that we have employed are descriptive in nature but serve
predictive purposes in the trading process. We extracted the amount of search
interests for all the stocks that we are interested in and use them as weights. We then
extracted the sentiment scores of all the articles for the stocks within our universe over
a period of time from 2007-01-01 to 2011-01-01 to generate a weighted sentiment
score.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ultimately, we used a relative-weighted-sentiment trading algorithm on a select
number of stocks within the S&amp;P 500 and achieved significant amount of alpha, that is
over 8000% cumulative return over the 4-year period of time.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We also conducted an event study on Murphy Oil Corporation to give a more
visual and intuitive presentation of the correlation between weighted sentiment score
and stock performance.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The weighted sentiment analysis is a powerful tool in devising a trading strategy. Our
trading algorithm has shown that the effectiveness of the weighted sentiment score is
maximized when we use it to engage in a contrarian investing strategy around the time of
financial crisis. Longing the companies receiving negative media attention actually yields higher
return and risk adjusted return both before and immediately after the financial crisis. We did not
have enough time to investigate the cause of this phenomenon. The ongoing hypothesis is to
that too much negative sentiment could attract the attention of contrarian investors thinking that
the stocks are undervalued.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is to say that in general companies with negative sentiment scores and surging
media attention tend to outperform on the day after the media attention, but this rule can not be
interpreted narrowly that companies with the lowest sentiment scores will outperform companies
with higher sentiment scores because our backtesting has indicated that longing the bottom
20% yields better result than longing the bottom 10%.</p>
