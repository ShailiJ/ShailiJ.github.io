<h3>Sentiment Analysis of Alexandria Articles (ML1)</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For this part we used a python natural language processing api to process several articles from alexandria to understand
the differences between the two, and how traditional NLP tools can be modified and adapted for financial analysis purposes</p>
<h3>Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob and Comparison with Alexandria’s Scores</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;TextBlob is a Python (2 and 3) library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for
diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging,
noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The first article that we experimented with is “Police Arrest 5 for Allegedly Jumping Deputy at
Disney World”, this article deals with exclusively non-financial data. And the TextBlob’s
sentiment analysis yields a sentiment score of 0.02 which is inline with Alexandria’s 0. It seems
that ACT has similar performance with normal NLP program in the face of a nonfinancial article.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The second article is “2 sentenced in Coke trade secret case” which deals with two publicly
traded companies, Coca-cola and pepsi. In this case, the sentiment analysis of TextBlob failed,
yielding a sentiment score of 0.12 vesus a -1 by ACT. If we look into the text of the file, no
emotional words are used, just factual statements. The lack of emotional words led TextBlob to
give this article a neutral score, but ACT managed to capture the negative impact that event has
on the relevant companies.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The third article is “Borse Dubai and NASDAQ Have Secured 47.6 Per Cent of OMX Shares
Through Direct Ownership, Option Agreements and Irrevocable Undertakings”, the TextBlob
Algorithm failed to capture the intrinsic positive effect of such transaction, yielding a sentiment
score of 0 while the ACTA yields a one. Here, the words that would be neutral in the normal
context actually should be interpreted as positive.</p>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Overall, the regular sentiment analysis does a good job interpreting events without
hidden financial connotation, however, if financial terms and events are involved. It is fairly
difficult for a standard NLP algorithm to detect the sentiment.<p>
<h3>Alexandria’s Sentiment Analysis Algorithm</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By contrast, ACTA’s sentiment classification engine offers key benefits:
  <p><ol>
    <li>ACTA applies its own probabilistic algorithms to sentiment assessment – employing
the patterns it has discovered through a statistical methodology – rather than be bound by rules
previously fixed by humans. This allows ACTA to apply a far more complex “understanding” of
the content it reads, including “unknown” rules and relationships that other systems can’t
identify.</li>
<li>ACTA dynamically selects and weights a virtually infinite range of classification
patterns based on the strength of relationships, not due to any pre-assigned weighting.</li>
<li>ACTA identifies sentiment within a broader context of meaning – given that the whole
of a given article is taken in by the engine and analyzed as opposed to any individual words
found within it. </li> </p>		</div><!-- /.blurb -->
